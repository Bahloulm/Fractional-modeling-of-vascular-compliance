# *NB
To enable future authors to perform reproducible and easily-compared assessments of novel algorithms, we provide this publicly available Matlab code used for the numerical implementation and models calibration in our paper (Fractional-order model representations of apparent vascular compliance as an alternative in the analysis of arterial stiffness: An in-silico study) study. The preprocessed data investigated in this study is also available along with the statistical analysis tools. We welcome developments to the existing code or contributions of new algorithms for inclusion in future versions of the arterial stiffness prediction platform.

# Abstract:
Recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of fractional-order calculus tools for probing the viscoelastic properties of collagenous tissue, characterizing the arterial blood flow and red cell membrane mechanics, and modeling the aortic valve cusp. In this article, we present novel lumped-parameter equivalent circuit models of the apparent arterial compliance using a fractional-order capacitor (FOC). FOC, which generalizes capacitors and resistors, displays a fractional-order behavior that can capture both elastic and viscous properties through a power-law formulation. The proposed framework describes the dynamic relationship between the blood pressure input and blood volume, using linear fractional-order differential equations. The results show that the proposed models present reasonable fit performance with in-silico data of more than 4,000 subjects. Additionally, strong correlations have been identified between the fractional-order parameter estimates and the central hemodynamic determinants as well as pulse wave velocity indexes. Therefore, fractional-order based paradigm of arterial compliance shows prominent potential as an alternative tool in the analysis of arterial stiffness.
